Similarity Measure
==================

## Summary
Content based similarity measure of the articles at given urls. Idea is based on representaton of each article as numerical statistic as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf
Term frequency is modified as per http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/html/htmledition/sublinear-tf-scaling-1.html
After the representation of two articles as vectors similarity measures as cosine of the angle between them (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity).

## Example of usage
In Program.cs there are three fields which are required: string testUrl1, string testUrl2 and int tresold.
Strings testUrl1 and testUrl2 should contain adreses to web pages which are comparing. 
Variable treshold is used during vocabulary creation. Probably, the best option is to set it to 2 for articles with lenght 200-400 words, but it should be tested.

After clicking run program will return something like:

> url1 consists of 424 words, url2 consists of 301 words.
> Vocabulary contains 41 words after tokenization and thresholding.
> Similarity is 0.8897
